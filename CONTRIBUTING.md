# Contributing

I am looking for a new maintainer (or maintainers) for this project.

I am no longer in a position to contribute to it (and haven't been for a while). I no longer have access to FortiGate 
hardware, and my career has moved in a direction where I am unlikely to cross paths with it any time soon.

I don't want to keep squatting on a project that I can no longer make meaningful contributions to, so I'm transferring
this project to an organization of it's own name, and will hand over maintainer permissions to whomever has an active
interest in maintaining it.

Please send me a message if you're interested in doing so.
